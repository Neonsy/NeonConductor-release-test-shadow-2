## PR Title (Required)

Use one of these formats:

- `type: short lowercase subject`
- `type(scope): short lowercase subject`

Allowed `type`: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`, `ui-ux`, `revert`

Optional `scope`: any lowercase kebab-case token (examples: `api`, `frontend`, `backend`, `electron`, `provider`, `agent`, `tools`, `infra`, `deps`)

Breaking change note:
- Add `!` before `:` to mark breaking intent, for example: `feat(api)!: remove legacy config format`
- Automation adds `type: breaking` when `!` is present
- Changesets still determine actual version bump behavior

Branch naming note:
- `proto` is allowed for branch names only (`username/proto/short-description`), not as a PR title type

## PR Type

- [ ] `feat`
- [ ] `fix`
- [ ] `chore`
- [ ] `docs`
- [ ] `refactor`
- [ ] `test`

- [ ] `build`
- [ ] `ci`

## Branch Flow Check

- [ ] This PR follows the branch flow rules (`dev -> prev`, `prev -> main`).
- [ ] For normal work, base branch is `dev`.
- [ ] If targeting `prev` or `main`, this is a promotion/release PR requested by a maintainer.

## Changeset Check

- [ ] This PR touches non-doc files in `Project/**` and includes the required changeset in `Project/.changeset/` (applies to `dev`, `prev`, and `main`).
- [ ] No changeset is required because this PR is docs-only in `Project/**` (markdown/docs paths) or does not change `Project/**`.

## Validation

- [ ] `pnpm -C Project lint`
- [ ] `pnpm -C Project typecheck`
- [ ] `pnpm -C Project test`
- [ ] I did not run one or more checks above, and explained why below.

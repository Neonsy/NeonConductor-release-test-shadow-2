## Status

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is currently under active development.

> The repo was rebased to tidy things up (only while the foundation is still being laid), and renamed from `KiloDesktop` to `NeonConductor` since it's not an official Kilo product... yet?

Release channels map to branches:

- **`dev` → alpha**
- **`prev` → beta**
- **`main` → stable**

Platform build testing coverage:

- **Windows:** [@Neonsy](https://github.com/Neonsy) is currently focused on making sure the Windows build works.
- **macOS:** [@bernaferrari](https://github.com/bernaferrari) and [@mikij](https://github.com/mikij) are able to test the macOS build.
- **Linux:** [@kylhuk](https://github.com/kylhuk/) is able to test the Linux build.

Stable releases are automated from `main` using Changesets
and update `Project/CHANGELOG.md`.
Pre-releases are published by tagging `dev` or `prev`
with `vX.Y.Z-alpha.N` / `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Alpha releases (`dev`)**
> Alpha builds are intended for testing and feedback.
> Stability and security posture can be uneven
> while features are still being integrated.
> Avoid using alpha for critical workflows or sensitive data.

> [!WARNING]
> **Beta releases (`prev`)**
> Beta builds are more stable than alpha, but still pre-release.
> Regressions and behavior changes can still occur before stable.

> [!NOTE]
> **Stable releases (`main`)**
> Stable builds are the most reliable channel in this project.
> Bugs and regressions can still occur,
> but the likelihood is lower than alpha and beta.
